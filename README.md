# AutoOpenWorkspace README

Very simple VS Code extension and mostly a copy of the HelloWorld example.

When VS Code opens a folder and if the folder contains a .code-workspace file then it will automatically open the workspace.

It was created because Microsoft said the community should implement but no one has.

This would be better handled by VS Code itself because to open a workspace is rather hacky.

Currently only works on Windows.

## Features

Automatically opens a .code-workspace file if present in a folder.

### 1.0.0

Initial release.
